# GovTribe.com Search Functionality Maintenance Notice

**Date:** [February 19, 2025]

## Overview

We are currently reindexing the GovTribe.com search pages as part of our commitment to enhance the accuracy, speed, and overall user experience of our platform. During this update, you may experience intermittent search performance issues.

## What You Need to Know

- **Ongoing Process:** Our reindexing efforts are actively underway and nearing completion.
- **No Final Timeline:** At this time, we do not have a finalized completion date for this maintenance.
- **Intermittent Impact:** You may notice occasional delays or variations in search results while the reindexing is in progress.

## How This May Affect You

- **Search Functionality:** Some search queries might return incomplete or delayed results.
- **User Experience:** You could experience intermittent access issues as we work to improve our search infrastructure.
- **User Experience:** You may notice that upon landing on a search index page, the results count that is default displayed is lower than prior state. This is because the results count is indicative of Popular opportunities currently being interacted with on the site. Apply a search (filter or keyword) to generate new results. 

## Our Commitment

We understand the importance of a reliable search experience and are working diligently to complete these improvements with minimal disruption. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated during this maintenance period.
